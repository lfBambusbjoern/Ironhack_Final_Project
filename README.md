# Ironhack_Final_Project
My goal is to analyze the connection between modern day music industry and a rise of gang related crime.


Motivation & Ideation:

I am a passionate listener of music. Through the last years the genre of rap and hip hop developed to be the main genre in modern pop cultural music. 

With this development, the topic of Gang related crime became more and more present through the music due to the fact, that people seem to strive for authenticity. 

This lead to a massive wave of gang related violence connected with the death of many artists like Pop Smoke (got shot after a home invasion after leaking his address in instagram live), XXXTentacion (drive-by-shooting), Nipsey Hussle (drive-by-shooting), etc.!

My goal is to analyze the connection between modern day music industry and a rise (?) of gang related crime.


Stages:


A: Crime Data Analysis US: How did gang related crime change through the last years? 
(Is there a rise of violence or not?)


Data Sources:

https://nationalgangcenter.ojp.gov/survey-analysis/gang-related-offenses

Q: Country-wide or specific for cities??
Q: Predictors?? -> Who got assassinated why??


B: Scrape Spotify API (Top Artists & Information about them) & Wikipedia (Where is the artist from? Is the artists still alive? If not, what is the cause of death? What is the real name? Is there a connection to the crime analysis?) to create a database that includes rap-artists from the last decade, check the gang realtion and compare this to the Crime Data Analysis.

Data Sources:
https://www.billboard.com/ (Charts)
Spotify API
Wikipedia

C: Check the gang relation and compare this to the Crime Data Analysis to find out, if there are any connections between raising gang related crime and upcoming artists with gang-background.


Milestones:


Step 1: Scrape Crime Data and build a cleaned database.
	Step 2: EDA Crime Data (Gang Related Crime over the last years)

Step 3: Scrape Top Hip Hop Artists from Billboard over the last years
	Step 4: Fill a database through additional information via Spotify API
	Step 5: Fill the database with additional information via Wikipedia
	Step 6: Clean the database
	Step 7: EDA Artist-Database

Step 8: Compare the Artist_Database and the GangViolence_Database and find patterns.
